* Avoid using char value a actual single char like '0' as much             *
* as possible. Instead, use their ASCII integer value. This is because     *
* it easier is to translate the code between languages. As depend on       *
* the language, the '0' might have to take an additional step to be        *
* converted to 48.                                                         *
*                                                                          *
* This project only support two's complements for sign type.               *
* For Endianness, v-mp supports Little and Big Endian. All other types     *
* can be disregarded.                                                      *
* This project does not yet support c89(ANSI C). The lowest minimum is     *
* c99(ISO/IEC 9899:1999)                                                   *

*  Indent: 4;                                                              *      
*                                                                          *
*  One line condition or loop block                                        *
*  1) If short can be on the same line.                                    *
*  2) If split to two lines, the indentation for the statement line should *
*     be the condition line stament's indentation + (indent / 2)           *
*  3) Empty conditional block or loop should be enclose with {} and on the *
*     same line. Exception to when the condition statement itself is       *
*     too long and needed to be split into multiple lines. In that event,  *
*     the {} brackets should be with the last line.                        *
*                                                                          *
*  Loop unrolling:                                                         *
*  1) Loops are encourage to be unrolled if doing so offer better          *
*     performance without sarcificing too much on code size or instruction *
*     cache misses. Generally loops that are known to execute more than 10 *
*     times shouldn't be unroll and should leave to the compiler to        *
*     determine how to optimize that.                                      *
*  2) When unrolling a loop, it should be done through macro, and the      *
*     macro definition should be undefined right after the last            *
*     usage.                                                               *
*                                                                          *
*  ** This style guideline maybe expand.                                   *
*                                                                          *
